# Deployment
I started working on this project in Repl.it because GitPod had a 50 our time limit and I like working from Repl.it more. <br>
I used GitPod for backups and to publish my website for the Milestone project 1<br>
This website starts with the: index.html, followed by the map ‘assets’, with a map of ‘images’ and a map of ‘css’. <br>
I used locations.html, for the locations page.<br>
I used reservation.html, for the reservation page.<br>
I used contact.html, for the contact page.<br>
In the ’css’ map you will find the page: style.css.<br>
A map called 'mockups' with small, medium and large wireframes.<br>
A map called ‘images' with an images.<br>
A map called ‘readme_images' with testing screenschots <br>
Ending with the README.md.
